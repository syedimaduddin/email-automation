I was facing issues while manually emailing a lot of people. It took me a lot of time and I wanted to save my time so I wrote python code whereby I sent email to multiple people with same subject and body, and only changed the person's name to make the mail personal.
This code will be helpful for those people who want to mail lots of professors for research internship and also helpful for people who are in marketing of any product.
